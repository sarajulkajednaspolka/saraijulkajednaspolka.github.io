<p><font color="purple">I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean</font>
<font color="red">I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand</font>
<font color="blue">But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did</font>
<font color="green">Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind</font></p>
<p>I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand</p>
<p>But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you</p>
<p>We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping I just stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while</p>
<p>Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish</p>
<p>Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song</p>
<p>But here I am
Next to you
The sky is so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you</p>
<p>We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true
In Malibu</p>
